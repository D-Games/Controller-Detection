# PS5 Controller Detection in Python

## Introduction

PS5 Controller Detection is a small piece of software that detects whether a PS5 controller is connected to the device by locating the Product and Vendor ID then displaying the output via a small window. 

The software dynamically changes the traffic light system within the window as well as the tray icon depending whether the controller is connected or not.
